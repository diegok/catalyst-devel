List of what I've done on Catalyst::Helper thus far:

6-03-2009
1. removed template code and hex data for images and put them into a directory
structure reflecting a Catalyst application's set up
2. Written a test to check to make sure the original C::H and new C::H code
create the exact same application, so we know nothing was broken.
3.  Implemented File::ShareDir to make use of a share/ directory in a distribution
for template files and images, etc.
4. working on a test script to test how deprecated methods are invoked, 2/3 working
5. implemented methods for new API and old deprecated methods.  1 for pulling 
File::ShareDir data out of our share/ directory, and another for backwards compatibility,
pulling data out of the __DATA__ section.
6. Drafted an RFC for more comments on progression of C::H API
7. Also using added Path::Class for file reading
as of 6-9-09
1. backwards compatibility tests pass
